# Shortcuts-in-the-visual-hierarchy

Spring 2018 Rotation Project with Dr. Max Riesenhuber

Participants were trained to make saccades to upright cars presented in different positions around a central fixation point; 4 of the 8 positions were 'trained'and 4 were not. They performed an EEG session before and after training, and the scripts to analyze the ERP data (preprocessing, clustering, and generating plots to characterize comparisons of interest as well as general data quality control).

Comparisons of interest:
Pre vs. Post Training
Trained vs. Untrained Positions
Upright vs. Inverted Cars
Left vs. Right Visual Field Presentations
